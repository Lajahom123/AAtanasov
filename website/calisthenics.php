        <h1>What is calisthenics</h1>
        <p>The origin of the word "calisthenics" comes from the Greek "kallos", which means "beauty" or "beautiful",
        and "sthenos", meaning "strength". It is the art of using one's bodyweight as resistance in order to develop 
        physique. The practice is really ancient, recorded in use even in Ancient Greece. In modern days, it exists in many 
        different forms such as gymnastics, street workout, parkour and other.</p>

        <p>Some of the main exercises in calisthenics are pull-ups, push-ups, squats, leg raises, dips, levers, handstands. 
        The exercises typically involve large muscle groups, which provides not only the benefits of muscular and aerobic conditioning, 
        but also improvement of psychomotor skills such as balance, agility and coordination. </p>

        <h1>Why calisthenics</h1>
        <p>Calisthenics, like any other method of training, is a tool to get the results you want and therefore depends on 
        which tools you would like to use. Here are some of the reasons why calisthenics is one of the best tools you can possibly use and is especially
        convenient for beginners. 
        </p>
        <ul class="list-training-pt">
        
            <li class="list-training-pt"><span class="list-training-pt-span">The first and probably the most important 
            advantage of calisthenics is that it can be done literally anywhere and at any time, so you can do everything 
            from the comfort of your home and still get amazing results.
            </span></li>

            <li class="list-training-pt"><span class="list-training-pt-span">With calisthenics all the necessary 
            equipment comes down to a pull-up bar or a pair of rings. Of course you can get resistance bands, parallets and
            other pieces, but they are not really mandatory. 
            </span></li>
            
            <li class="list-training-pt"><span class="list-training-pt-span">For beginners, there is a very low risk of injury
            compared to, for example weightlifting, where you can seriously hurt yourself if you drop the weight.
            </span></li>

            <li class="list-training-pt"><span class="list-training-pt-span">The fundamental exercises are easy on the joints 
            and do not require a high skill capability.
            </span></li> 

            <li class="list-training-pt"><span class="list-training-pt-span">You have a lot of freedom in your training and, even
            when freestyling and experimenting with countless combinations, the process can still be benefitial and joyful.
            </span></li>
