        <p class="font-about-page">Hi, my name is Atanas Atanasov and I'm deeply interested in bodyweight movement a.k.a. 
            calisthenics. Ever since I started working out, I have gained a lot of experience in different styles and methods
            of training, such as building strength, increasing muscle mass, improving mobility and flexibility, developing 
            physical endurance and weightlifting. During this time, I have obtained vast knowledge, which I still continue to 
            increase and want to share with you all.

        <p class="font-about-page">
            My first ever training experience has to be a little over 5 years ago when I began weightlifting. I have always
            been on the skinnier side so I thought it would be awesome if got stronger and bigger. During the summer break, I 
            would regularly go to the gym, but once it ended, I completely dumped working out. I tried training at home
            the next year, which I unfortunately once again quit after a month or so. It wasn't until my aunt gave me the book 
            "Convict Conditioning" (which I highly recommend) that my life completely changed. Then, I became completely obsessed 
            with calisthenics, tried to learn every piece of obtainable information and non-stop worked out. Since then, I made a 
            lot of mistakes and had a bunch of failures, but I never let them lead me off track. Moreover, I turned them 
            into a source of motivation to come to where I am currently at - enjoying a healthy lifestyle and defying 
            gravity, with no intention of ever stopping.
